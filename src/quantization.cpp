/*
 * Snapshot packet compression via lossy integer encoding.
 *
 * We sacrifice precision to save bandwidth without noticeable quality loss. The dominant
 * source of visual error is (by a significant margin) latency/jitter.
 * Position compressed from float (4 bytes) to int16_t (2 bytes) by scaling by 500, which
 * gives Â±65m range at 2mm precision, which isn't noticeable.
 *
 * We could go A LOT further on space savings, either by quantizing input packets, or by implementing
 * delta encoding. The latter is where each snapshot no longer has the full game state, but only what has
 * changed from the last snapshot, Requiring change tracking and stateful decoding
 * on both sides.
 *
 * To clarify, quantization doesn't make any difference whatsoever here, but bandwidth reduction is
 * something that proper systems do, so it's worth implementing at least a lite version.
